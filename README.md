# Expense Tracker CLI Application
Python 3.12.3, Linux, CLI, JSON

## About This Project

A small expense tracker that can stores expense data in JSON and allows users to complete basic commands such as adding, deleting, and viewing their expenses. 

This project was developed in Python 3.12.3 and stores the user's expenses in JSON files. Python's argparse module/library is used to parse the positional and optional arguments given by the user through the Linux CLI to manage their expenses. 

## List of positional/optional arguments:
- add
- update
- delete
- list
- summarize


Working in a Linux environment is new to me, so this expense tracker has helped me familiarize myself with creating something that parsed command line arguments in the terminal.
